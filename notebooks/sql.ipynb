    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "## The SQL analysis reinforces several key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mental Health and Work Location: Thereâ€™s a notable relationship between work location and mental health outcomes.\n",
    "Hybrid workers show higher levels of both anxiety and depression, while onsite workers are more prone to burnout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stress Levels:\n",
    "Remote workers report lower stress, with the highest number of employees reporting low stress levels.\n",
    "Hybrid workers are more evenly split between medium and high stress levels, reflecting the mixed experiences of balancing remote and onsite work.\n",
    "Onsite workers tend to experience more high stress, suggesting that onsite work environments may be more demanding or less flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Productivity:\n",
    "Remote work boosts productivity in many cases, with more employees reporting increased productivity compared to hybrid or onsite work.\n",
    "Hybrid work, while offering flexibility, may lead to decreased productivity in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Work-Life Balance:\n",
    "Hybrid workers reported a wide range of work-life balance ratings, with some experiencing lower satisfaction. Onsite workers also showed more mixed work-life balance results, while remote workers showed more consistency in maintaining a balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis provides valuable insights that align with the projectâ€™s objectives, demonstrating how work location impacts mental health, stress, work-life balance, and productivity. These findings can help guide companies in refining their policies to enhance employee well-being and support, especially in adapting work arrangements to individual needs and reducing stress across different work environments."
